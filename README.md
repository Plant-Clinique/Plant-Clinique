## DB Associations

# App views
* My Account: Will welcome you to the app, show any notifications you have, and more. You can ask a question, edit your own info, and add a plant to your "garden". Your garden will be cards of plants below your user information. These will be able to be edited, removed, and in the chatbot you will be prompted to ask about these.  
-pic here-
* Chatbot: The chatbot uses a multiple choice questionairre to ascertain information for the user. These different options will grow. There is also a plus sign on all pages (when logged in) in the bottom right corner for an instant jump to the chatbot aside from the navbar. 
-pic here-
* Posts: This page is robust because posts can be filed by a different enum topic, and because a post can have many replies. The URL patterns above demonstrate the many functionalities, but this is our basic forum. Currently we have used data from the Faker gem to populate posts (Faker::Movies::Ghostbusters.quote). All of the posts you post are editable, and all the comments you post are editable.  
-pic here-
* Login/Sign Up/Logout: The Login is basic with a place for your email and password. The sign up has a space for you username, user email, and password. The Log out takes you back to the log in. 
-pic here-
* application.html.erb (header, footer, scrollbar): this is the code where we implemented the navbar, the footer, and the scroll bar. The scroll bar is just some CSS. The footer will have links to helpful areas. The navbar has links to the other pages, including a login and log out 
-pic here-
* What's next 
    * Reminders/Notifications: The navbar for this will be a simple link like the others however this will have an additional badge to show the current unread notifications. This pages functionalily will be based around the URL patterns outlined above. There will also be a clock on right with a calendar date so that the user knows what time they are putting into their reminder. We will also use a gem to email you if a reminder has been pending for a day. 
    * Maps: This page will show you a local view of the area around you, marking parks, hiking locations, etc with a tree icon and a dollar icon over stores that sell/deal with plants. 
    * Weekly Contest: a 7 day period where different plants are admitted to it and verified users vote on best plant that week (will remain up until new plant voted on)

# Dependencies (APIs, Gem, Libraries)
## APIs
* [Trefle](https://trefle.io/): Currently used in the [chatbot](https://github.com/Plant-Clinique/Plant-Clinique/blob/9871876d25563ac6196ea39ce81cd14a7a9c5777/app/helpers/chatbot_messages_helper.rb#L13-L14) to get information about plants based on plant type, including sunlight, water, temperature, and many more. It has an exhaustive list of plants sourced from USDA, Wikimedia, and more. 
* [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api): Planning to use this for fetching weather at the current user's location so that we can estimate temperatures and better understand what plants the user can grow at home.
* [Ambee Soil](https://www.getambee.com/api/soil): Planning to use this for fetching soil information to better estimate what plants the user can grow at home.
## Gems
* [Clearance](https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance): Currently used for authenticating/authorizing users and things like remembering them and validating their login/signup data. We're working on finalizing the forgot-password feature using this gem, as well. 
* [binding_of_caller](https://github.com/banister/binding_of_caller): Currently used in development to aid in debugging. It allows us to evaluate code to check the state of our objects whenever we hit an error directly in the browser.
* [rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop): Currently used for our backend team to check code style. We also have it set up in a GitHub workflow action ([check here](https://github.com/Plant-Clinique/Plant-Clinique/blob/473db669e95584defb644bd3e156ca7bab2a36cc/.github/workflows/rails.yml#L50)) to easily see what the linter thinks about the code in the pull request (e.g. [see how it evaluated for this PR](https://github.com/Plant-Clinique/Plant-Clinique/runs/2108178436?check_suite_focus=true)).
* [Kaminari](https://github.com/kaminari/kaminari): Currently used for paginating the posts page every 7 posts. We didn't like how we had to scroll way down to see all posts because then we would have to scroll all the way back to get to the topics pills; this solved the problem.
* [active_record-events](https://github.com/pienkowb/active_record-events): Currently used for adding an editted tag to posts that have been edited. It also allows us to keep track of the exact time a post was edited. We plan to use this for replies as well.
* [Wicked](https://github.com/zombocom/wicked): Planning to use this in the chatbot so that it can ask more types of questions without bloating the code. This is currently in progress ([here is the PR](https://github.com/Plant-Clinique/Plant-Clinique/pull/44)).
* [Select2](https://github.com/argerim/select2-rails): Planning to use this to integrate jQuery Select2 plugin that allows users to search in a selectbox. This would be very useful for searching plant types when making or updating a user plant. 
* [Noticed](https://github.com/excid3/noticed): Planning to integrate this with our Twilio powered reminders that are currently in progress as well.
## More
* [Heroku Scheduler](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler): Planning to use this to help us with sending reminders to users. 
* [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/12/send-sms-ruby-rails-5-coffee.html): Planning to use this to send the reminders to users through sms.
